# ðŸ“Š Regression Methods for Time Series Analysis

This repository provides a brief introduction and Python implementations of various **regression techniques** applied to **noisy and nonlinear time series data**. The main objective is to evaluate the performance of different regression models under varying noise levels using synthetic datasets, particularly in the context of astronomical signal analysis.

## ðŸ“˜ Methods Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Fourier Regression**
- **Splines**
- **Kernel Regression**
- **GRNN (General Regression Neural Network)**

Each method is applied to reconstruct nonlinear curves from artificially generated datasets.
