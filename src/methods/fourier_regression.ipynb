    "### **Overview of Time Series Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis involves studying data collected over time to uncover patterns, relationships, and underlying structures. A key first step is visualizing the data over time, which can suggest appropriate models and highlight important features. There are two major—but complementary—approaches to time series analysis: ([1][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Time Domain Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Focus**: Models the **dependence of current values on past values**.\n",
    "* **Method**: Uses **linear regression** techniques to express a variable $ ( x_t ) $ as a function of its own lagged values (e.g., $ ( x_{t-1}, x_{t-2} ) $) and/or lagged values of other variables (e.g., $ ( y_{t-1}, y_{t-2} )$).\n",
    "* **Applications**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Forecasting** (e.g., economic data like GDP or unemployment)\n",
    "  * **Smoothing and filtering**, often using **local regression**, **polynomials**, or **splines**\n",
    "* **Advantages**: Often performs better for **shorter time series** and is widely used in economics. ([1][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Frequency Domain Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Focus**: Identifies **periodic patterns or cycles** within the data using **sinusoidal components**.\n",
    "* **Method**: Applies **spectral analysis** to decompose a time series into its frequency components, producing a **power spectrum** that shows how variance is distributed across frequencies.\n",
    "* **Concepts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Frequency (ω)** is measured in cycles per time point.\n",
    "  * **Period** is the number of time points per cycle.\n",
    "  * **Coherence** measures the strength of the relationship between two series at specific frequencies.\n",
    "* **Applications**: Useful in fields such as **engineering**, **biomedicine**, **oceanography**, and **geophysics**, where natural or environmental cycles are significant. ([1][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unifying Theme: The Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear models are **central** to both approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In the **time domain**, regression is used to model future values based on past observations.\n",
    "  * In the **frequency domain**, regression with **sine and cosine inputs** leads to the **periodogram** and **spectral analysis**.\n",
    "* **Time-invariant linear filters** play a key role, functioning similarly to regression models and enabling both forecasting and smoothing.\n",
    "* The use of **least squares estimation** for model parameters connects time series analysis directly to classical statistical techniques. ([1][1])\n",
